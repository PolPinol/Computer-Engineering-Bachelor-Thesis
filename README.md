# TFG
The main objective of this project is to reproduce a real-time strategy multiplayer video game with its own theme and different from the popular ones, solving the loading and slowness problems that these types of video games have due to the continuous calls to the database .

During the development of the video game, Clean Code techniques and patterns will be applied, using from the start an optimal design, software patterns and complete documentation of the code and tools used.

Finally, we want the video game, and its servers, to be fully functional from the day they open to the public. The goal would be that even if a person was playing on a server completely alone, the experience would be similar to playing with people.
